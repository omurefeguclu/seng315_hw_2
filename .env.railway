# Railway-specific environment setup
# This file is for documentation - set these in Railway dashboard

# Required Environment Variables for BOTH services (web and worker):
# DATABASE_URL - Automatically provided by Railway Postgres plugin: ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
# REDIS_URL - Automatically provided by Railway Redis plugin: ${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
# NODE_ENV - Set to: production

# Web Service Only:
# PORT - Railway automatically provides this, or defaults to 3000

# Instructions:
# 1. Create a new project on Railway
# 2. Add PostgreSQL plugin (creates DATABASE_URL variable)
# 3. Add Redis plugin (creates REDIS_URL variable)
# 4. Deploy from GitHub:
#    - Service 1 (Web): Use root directory, Dockerfile: Dockerfile
#    - Service 2 (Worker): Use root directory, Dockerfile: Dockerfile.worker
# 5. Both services will automatically reference the DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL
